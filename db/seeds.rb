First off, the author of this novel is American. I’m not sure how to feel about that, as I’d rather read an authentic narration. Having said that, this is a work of fiction and not a history book, so maybe that’s not a reasonable expectation. The author has some Chinese ancestry, and has written several works of fiction centering around China, as well as a non fiction book about her family’s history, so she’s definitely an expert. (cough cough Dan Brown cough) The sisters, Pearl and May, move from Shanghai to LA as part of arranged marriages. Their family has lost its wealth, and there were not many options for women in those days. They soon find that their husbands and in-laws have many secrets, but so do the girls. Together, they try to make their way in Chinatown and Hollywood. The novel is structured into three books depicting different stages of the girls’ lives. Each touches upon different themes- society girls in Shanghai, the second Sino-Japanese war, the immigrant experience at Ellis Island, Chinese “paper” sons and immigration scams, the Hollywood craze, minority culture in the USA, the experiences of first generation Americans and the antipathy towards communism under Joseph McCarthy. While the book is never overly instructive, I felt that the emphasis on mentioning all these important social issues was at the expense of character development and plot. Unfortunately, women of that era were very much limited by social conventions- Pearl’s entire world was more or less limited to her husband’s family after she moves to LA. There is some drama in the first book, but the big reveal is left for the very end of book three, with most of the consequences being after the book’s end.",category_id: 1,author_id: 1)
